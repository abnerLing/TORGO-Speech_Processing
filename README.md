# Kaldi-based ASR for the TORGO dataset
- Simple GMM-HMM acoustic model for teaching Kaldi.
- Simple DNN-HMM acoustic model.
- Language model building scripts come from https://github.com/cristinae/ASRdys script.

### While you could just excute the run.sh script all at once it's recommended to run by stages to better understand the code and debug any errors.
#### Stage 1: Language model building
#### Stage 2: Acoustic feature extraction (MFCC)
#### Stage 3: GMM-HMM AM training
#### Stage 4: Decode and score
